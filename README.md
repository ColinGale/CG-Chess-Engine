# CG-Chess-Engine
Chess with an chess engine game mode using AlejoG10's Python code and Pygame

# Introduction
With the help from user AlejoG10's Python chess game, this program implements a MiniMax algorithm, Quiescene search, and webscrapping (for finding opening databases) to create a chess engine that plays against the user. This program also made some changes to AlejoG10's original chess code in order to fix bugs that involved how moves were calculated whilst the player was in check and how the castling moves were calculated. In its current version, the chess engine searches positions at a depth of 3 moves ahead (2 of all moves and 1 with quiescene search), holds an opening database of 3 moves from webscrapping, and plays at around 600-700 ELO.

# Version History
